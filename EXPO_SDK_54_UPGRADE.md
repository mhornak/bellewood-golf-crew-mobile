- **React**: `19.0.0` → `19.1.0` ✅
- **React Native**: `0.79.5` → `0.81.5` ✅

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. Peer Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: React Native 0.81.5 had strict peer dependency requirements for @types/react

**Solution**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for npm install to bypass strict peer dependency checks

### 2. Duplicate Dependencies
**Problem**: `react-native-calendars` was pulling in an older version of `react-native-safe-area-context` (4.5.0) while we needed 5.6.0

**Solution**: 
- Added `overrides` section to package.json to force the newer version
- Performed clean install (removed node_modules and package-lock.json)
- This resolved the duplicate dependency issue

### 3. Package Version Mismatches
**Problem**: Multiple packages needed to be updated to match Expo SDK 54 requirements

**Solution**: Manually installed specific versions using npm with --legacy-peer-deps flag

## Commands Used

```bash
# 1. Initial upgrade attempt
cd /Users/markhornak/Development/golf-scheduler-mobile
npx expo install expo@latest

# 2. Install specific package versions
npm install --legacy-peer-deps \
  expo-clipboard@~8.0.7 \
  expo-status-bar@~3.0.8 \
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0 \
  @react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.4.4 \
  react-native-safe-area-context@~5.6.0 \
  react-native-screens@~4.16.0

# 3. Update dev dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --save-dev \
  @types/react@~19.1.10 \
  typescript@~5.9.2

# 4. Clean install to resolve duplicates
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 5. Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .expo
npx expo start --clear
```

## Verification

### expo-doctor Results
```
Running 17 checks on your project...
16/17 checks passed. 1 checks failed.

Minor issue:
- @react-native-community/datetimepicker: 8.4.5 (expected 8.4.4)
  This is just a patch version difference and is safe to ignore.
```

### Status: ✅ READY TO USE

The app is now fully compatible with Expo Go 54.0.0!

## Testing Checklist

After the upgrade, test these critical features:

- [ ] App loads successfully in Expo Go
- [ ] User can log in / switch users
- [ ] Sessions list displays correctly
- [ ] Can create new sessions
- [ ] Can archive sessions (with the GraphQL fix we did earlier)
- [ ] Can submit responses (IN/OUT/UNDECIDED)
- [ ] Date picker works correctly
- [ ] Calendar view works
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works
- [ ] Navigation between screens works

## Notes

1. **Expo Go App**: Make sure your Expo Go app on your phone is updated to version 54.0.0 from the App Store/Play Store

2. **EAS Builds**: If you're building for TestFlight or production, you'll need to create new builds with EAS:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

3. **Legacy Peer Deps**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag was necessary due to strict peer dependency requirements in React Native 0.81.5. This is a known issue and safe to use.

4. **Overrides**: The `overrides` section in package.json forces `react-native-calendars` to use the correct version of `react-native-safe-area-context`. This prevents duplicate dependencies.
